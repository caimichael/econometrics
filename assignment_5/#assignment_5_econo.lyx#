\begin_layout Subparagraph*
1a) Consider the regression 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1i}+ui$
\end_inset

.
 Do you think that 
\begin_inset Formula $E[u_{i}|X_{i}]=0?$
\end_inset

 Is the OLS estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 unbiased and consistent? Explain.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $E[u_{i}|X_{1i}]\neq0$
\end_inset

 because there is important information contained in the 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 that is not controlled for by random selection to create the classes, namely
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2i}$
\end_inset

.
 If current students and new students were randomly and evenly placed into
 small/regular sized classes, then there would be no bias and there would
 be consistency in the estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 ;however, because 20% of the new students are assigned to the small-sized
 classes and 80% are assigned to the regular-sized classes, there are more
 new students in regular sized classes than there are in small classes.
 This is a case of sample selection bias, and thus the OLS assumption 1
 is violated and consequently the OLS estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 is biased and inconsistent.

1b) Consider the regression 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1i}+\beta_{2}X_{2i}+ui.$
\end_inset

 Do you think that 
\begin_inset Formula $E[u_{i}|X_{1i},X_{2i}]$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

? Is the OLS estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 unbiased and consistent? Explain.
 Do you think that 
\begin_inset Formula $E[u_{i}|X_{1i},X_{2i}]$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}?$
\end_inset

 Will the OLS estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}$
\end_inset

 provide an unbiased and consistent estimate of the causal effect of transferrin
g to a new school (that is, being a newly enrolled student)? Explain.

\begin_layout Standard
The first two questions basically ask: 
\begin_inset Formula $E[u_{i}|X_{1i},X_{2i}]=E[u_{i}|X_{2i}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta_{1}}\rightarrow_{p}\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Or rather, if you were to control for whether or not a student was newly
 enrolled, does the class size have explanatory power over test scores.
 The answer is yes, and thus the conditional mean independence does not
 hold.
 The class size, as we spoke about during lecture, still proxies for many
 other aspects of a school district such as income level, which is positively
 correlated with test scores and has a non-zero covariance with class size
 (assuming wealthier school districts can afford more instructors and thus
 more personalized classroom experiences resulting in a smaller student
 to teacher ratio).
 Therefore, the OLS estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 will be biased and inconsistent.

The second two questions ask: 
\begin_inset Formula $E[u_{i}|X_{1i},X_{2i}]=E[u_{i}|X_{1i}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta_{2}}\rightarrow\beta_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Or rather, if you were to control for the class size, does the fact that
 a student was newly enrolled have explanatory power over test scores.
 The answer is likely no, assuming that these new students enrolling are
 not all coming from say a non-English speaking background.
 Therefore, the conditional mean independence holds, and we can thus use
 the following derivation to prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta_{2}}$
\end_inset

 is a consistent and unbiased estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming these are true:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1i}+\beta_{2}X_{2i}+u_{i}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}=E[u_{i}|X_{1i},X_{2i}]+v_{i}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1i}+\beta_{2}X_{2i}+E[u_{i}|X_{1i},X_{2i}]+v_{i}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And using the conditional mean independence assumption that: 
\begin_inset Formula $E[u_{i}|X_{1i},X_{2i}]=E[u_{i}|X_{1i}]$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1i}+\beta_{2}X_{2i}+E[u_{i}|X_{1i}]+v_{i}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $E[u_{i}|X_{1i}]$
\end_inset

 follows the form 
\begin_inset Formula $a+bX_{1i}$
\end_inset

 we get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=(\beta_{0}+a)+(\beta_{1}+b)X_{1i}+\beta_{2}X_{2i}+v_{i}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we have proven that although the intercept and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 estimator will be biased, the estimator for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}$
\end_inset

 will be an unbiased and consistent estimator for the causal effect of transferr
ing to a new school (being a newly enrolled student).
